In this challenge, weâ€™ll install Stratis.

Stratis consists of two components.

First, the Stratis daemon, stratisd: - manages collections of block
devices - provides a D-Bus API

Second, the Stratis command-line interface, stratis-cli: - uses the
D-Bus API to communicate with stratisd

To start off, install the stratisd and stratis-cli packages using a
software package manager.

[source,bash,run]
----
sudo dnf -y install stratisd stratis-cli
----

You can check the stratis-cli version.

[source,bash,run]
----
stratis --version
----

Now, enable and start the stratisd systemd service using the systemctl
utility.

[source,bash,run]
----
sudo systemctl --now enable stratisd
----

At any point, you may also check the status of stratisd.

[source,bash,run]
----
systemctl status stratisd --no-pager
----

.service listing

If stratisd is running, you should see the Active: information report
active (running) as it is shown in the above output from the systemctl
status command.
