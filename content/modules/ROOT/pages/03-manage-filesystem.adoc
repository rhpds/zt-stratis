== Create a filesystem

A filesystem is a hierarchy of directories that is used to organize
files on a storage media. Multiple Stratis filesystems may be created
from a pool. Like pools, all filesystems must have a name; you can name
the filesystem my_first_fs.

Create my_first_fs from the pool that you created, my_pool.

[source,bash,run]
----
stratis filesystem create my_pool my_first_fs
----

== List filesystems

At any point, you may list all existing Stratis filesystems.

[source,bash,run]
----
stratis filesystem list
----

____
[!NOTE] There is a shortcut command `+stratis fs+` that performs the
same operation.
____

.list fs

== Rename a filesystem

It is possible to rename a filesystem. This may be useful for a variety
of reasons, such as updating the name of a test filesystem to a
production ready name.

Rename `+my_first_fs+` to a new name, `+my_fs+`.

[source,bash,run]
----
stratis filesystem rename my_pool my_first_fs my_fs
----

Then list the result.

[source,bash,run]
----
stratis fs
----

.renamed

== Mount a filesystem

Mounting a filesystem means making the particular filesystem accessible
at a certain point in the Linux directory tree. Your filesystem is
unmounted, and cannot be used to store, read from, or write to files.

Choose a mount point, the directory in which the filesystem will be
mounted. You will mount the filesystem, `+my_fs+`, in the directory
`+/mnt/test_mnt+`.

[source,bash,run]
----
mkdir /mnt/test_mnt
----

Mount the filesystem using the `+mount+` command.

[source,bash,run]
----
mount /dev/stratis/my_pool/my_fs /mnt/test_mnt
----

The mount point, `+/mnt/test_mnt+`, will now be the root directory of
the filesystem.

__Warning:__ If you do not choose an empty directory, the directoryâ€™s
previous contents will become hidden until the filesystem is unmounted.

Confirm that the filesystem has been mounted by running the mount
command.

[source,bash,run]
----
mount
----

.mount output
image::../assets/mountoutput.png[mount output]

From the above output, you can see that the filesystem is now mounted
successfully in the `+/mnt/test_mnt+` directory.

== Create files on mounted filesystem

Create two empty files in the filesystem, my_fs.

[source,bash,run]
----
touch /mnt/test_mnt/my_first_file
----

[source,bash,run]
----
touch /mnt/test_mnt/my_second_file
----

Check that the files have been created.

[source,bash,run]
----
ls /mnt/test_mnt
----

.two files
image::../assets/twofiles.png[two files]

Both files are now accessible in the /mnt/test_mnt directory.
